To start developing with meteor, head straight to [Meteor Docs Site](http://docs.meteor.com/) 

Read it as much as you can. Once, you understand all the underlying concepts of meteor, try out [meteor examples] (https://www.meteor.com/examples)

And finally start developing your own app. Guess what? There is boilerplate for that too! I found [this] (https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-boilerplate) one particularly good.
