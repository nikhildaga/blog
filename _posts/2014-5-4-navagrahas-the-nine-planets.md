Let us meet the nine Superpowers that influence the beings on Earth.

The Navagrahas or the nine planets consist of  The Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu (north or ascending lunar node) and Ketu (south or descending lunar node).

As posted earlier, these nine planets are just like people working in an organization.

They have their own peculiar nature and characteristics.

Their inherent abilities make they perform better in certain houses (departments) and under-perform in some others.

They have friendships and enmity among themselves.

They get exalted (excited) when placed in their favorable sign (environment) and become debilitated (nervous) when placed in hostile sign ( environment).

When they are happy, they give good results and when sad give poor or bad results.

And guess what ?
Just like you can get even upset people to work by pleasing or motivating them , you can make an upset planet to give good results by pleasing them through “mantras” and gemstones.

Interesting! Isn’t it?

In the future posts, we will learn more about each of these superpower one by one in details.



P.S.
In Sanskrit ग्रह gráha actually means seizing/ laying hold of / holding (life).
As such even the Sun, Moon, North node and South node are grahas .
The word planet for “Graha” is actually a misnomer. Anyways, for easy understanding, we will continue to call grahas as planets.


All said and done, ultimately, the fate of company also depends on the product that its developing . Similarly, the fate of a person also depends on the karma he / she performs.
