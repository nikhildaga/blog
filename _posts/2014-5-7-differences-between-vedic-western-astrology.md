title: Differences between the Vedic and Western Astrology
category: astrology

##Difference in the method of measurement
Vedic (Jyotiṣa) and Western zodiacs differ in the method of measurement.

While synchronically, the two systems are identical,
Jyotiṣa uses primarily the sidereal zodiac (in which stars are considered to be the fixed background against which the motion of the planets is measured), whereas most Western astrology uses the tropical zodiac (the motion of the planets is measured against the position of the Sun on the Spring equinox).

This difference becomes noticeable over time. After two millennia, as a result of the precession of the equinoxes, the origin of the ecliptic longitude has shifted by about 22 degrees.

As a result the placement of planets in the Jyotiṣa system is consistent with the actual zodiac, while in western astrology the planets fall into the following sign, as compared to their placement in the sidereal zodiac, about two thirds of the time.

##Difference in the zodiac sign
Many people have confusion regarding the difference in their birth sign as per Western and Vedic Astrology.

The main reason behind the confusion is that Western Astrology considers the sun sign as birth sign (sign where sun was present at birth) while Vedic Astrology considers the moon sign (where moon was present at birth time) as birth sign.

(Sun sign astrology is the form of astrology most commonly found in many newspaper and magazine columns. In India, generally, the children’s name were/are given on the basis on their moon sign.)


##Difference in chart structure
The Western chart is round in shape and includes neptune and pluto while the Vedic Astrology chart is square in shape and does not take into account neptune and pluto.

##Other Differences
Being based on Vedic philosophy, Vedic astrology includes several other elements such as Karmic factors, Dashas, Muhurta, Prashna, etc. which are not present in Western Astrology.
