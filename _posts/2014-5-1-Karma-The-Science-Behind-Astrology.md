A child is born on that day and at that hour when the celestial rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its probable future results.

Our Vedic birth charts are maps of karma, showing a schedule of events that will unfold throughout our lives. 

The sages created Vedic astrology to help human beings understand the cycles of their lives based on karma they'd created in previous incarnations. The horoscope was designed as a kind of report card for the soul that summarized their level of accomplishment up to the moment they were born. It revealed the karmic status of different areas in their life such as family, romance, career, finances, and spiritual growth. It also showed when particular karmas from the past were most likely to manifest in the course of their life.

And because Vedic astrology helped people see into blind spots in the past and future, it has been called Jyotir Vidya in Sanskrit, meaning "the science of light".

In the previous para, we learned that Vedic birth chart sketches a quick picture of our sanchita karma, the karma we've accumulated during our numerous past births. Subcharts called amshas reveal our prarabdha karma, the fraction of our total karma that will play out in our present lifetime.

But few astrologers are more than seventy percent accurate. The very best might be eighty percent correct on a good day. What's the reason behind it?

The reason is kriyamana karma, the karma we're creating now. The horoscope only reveals our karmic status up to the moment of our birth. The chart also reveals the samskaras or tendencies we carry in our karmashaya, the repository of karma in our causal body. But from the moment of birth our attitudes and behaviors in this life modify the future course of our karma, for better or worse. By living with full awareness, making wise choices, and acting effectively and compassionately, we can to a large extent override the vectors of destiny that were set in motion when we took our first breath.

##Vedic astrology does not tell us what will happen in our future. It tells us what might happen unless we consciously act to prevent or modify it.

##Your destiny isn't written in stone; it is a living thing that changes subtly as your level of consciousness changes.*


Now, lets understand Karma.

According to the yoga tradition, karma comes in three strengths.

First, there's the karma that's easy to change. For example, if you sign up for a course in vegetarian cooking but then decide you'd rather take a meditation class, you can switch courses quite easily.

Second, there's karma that can be altered only with substantial effort. If you graduate with a degree in law, but then decide you'd rather be a doctor instead, you can go back to college and get a medical degree, but it will cost you a lot of time and money.

The vast majority of karma playing out in our lives falls into these two categories.

The third type is fixed karma. These are the lessons we can't get out of the experiences we must undergo for the sake of our spiritual growth. Some individuals are born to fame (the children of royalty, for example) or to wealth. They have to deal with the issues this karma brings with it, whether they like it or not. Others may inevitably have to go through a traumatic event like the loss of a loved one or a serious accident or illness. Only a small portion of our total karma is unalterable, however.

Again remember,
Vedic astrology does not tell us what will happen in our future. It tells us what might happen unless we consciously act to prevent or modify it.

There is also a completely different kind of karma that can impact our lives drastically: collective karma.
If someone who is running a cycle that is signaling physical danger happens to live in a peace-loving culture, for example, she may fall and break her leg  on the fateful day. Someone else, however, running the same cycle but living in a culture with a high tolerance for violence, may be the victim of a mugging or assault. It is absolutely wrong to claim that the victim of a crime karmically "deserved it."

Just as individuals generate karma, so do neighborhoods, organizations, and nations. Group karma can override or strongly modify individual karma, particularly during collective experiences like war. This shows that we are responsible not only for our own actions but for the attitudes and acts of the communities of which we are members.
