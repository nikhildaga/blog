*Bhavas* or The Houses of Life

There are a total of 12 Bhavas or Houses positioned in a chart in Vedic Astrology.

As posted earlier, the Bhavas or the Houses in a chart are just like departments in an organization. Each of the twelve houses signifies a special region of life be it health or relations or finance.

Just as different departments have different working environment in different companies , similarly different houses have different signs in different people’s chart.

Just as different people are assigned different departments based on their position, the 9 planets get placed in these houses based on their position in the sky.

Just as the departments have a special space allocated to them in a company, the houses have a special space allocated to them in a chart.

And how can we forget that not all departments have the same status. Similarly not all houses have the same status.

There are 3 main categories of houses:

1. Kendras or Quadrants (1,4,7,10) : These are strong houses for grahas to occupy.

2. Trikona or Triangles (1,5,9) : These are the most auspicious houses.

3. Dusthāna or Painful (6,8,12):  These are the less fortunate houses which tend to rule unhappy areas.

What else?

There’s a lot more but I think its enough for today. We will learn more about all the houses in details in future posts.

Till then, understand the placements of the houses and the main aspect of life they represent from the following figure
