How do planets, houses and signs in Vedic Astrology work together to influence human life?

To help you understand how these elements of astrology work together to influence human life,  lets take a look at this analogy.

Think of
human life as an organization,
planets as people,
houses as departments,
signs as working conditions.

People, Departments and  Working Environment are the 3 important elements affecting an Organization. Similarly, Planets, Houses and Signs are the 3 important elements affecting human life.

An organizationâ€™s fate is decided by how its people work in various departments under different conditions. Similarly, the fate of human life is decided by how the planets perform in different houses under different signs.

Whenever a competent person is placed in a good department under good working environment , he/she will give excellent results. Similarly, whenever a strong planet is placed in a good house under good sign, it will give excellent results  and vice versa.


P.S.
What about Charts?
Charts are how we know which planet is in which house under which sign.
